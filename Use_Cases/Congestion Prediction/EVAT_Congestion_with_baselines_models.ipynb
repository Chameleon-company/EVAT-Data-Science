    "   - `dayofweek`: Day of the week (0 = Monday, 6 = Sunday).  \n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Cyclical time features (to capture repeating patterns)**\n",
    "   - Since the grid is 3-hourly, there are **8 bins per day**.  \n",
    "   - `hod`: Hour of day in 3-hour bins (0–7).  \n",
    "   - `hod_sin` and `hod_cos`: Convert the hour-of-day into sine and cosine values.  \n",

    "\n",

    "     - `arrivals_ma4` = average arrivals over the past 4 bins (12 hours).  \n",
    "     - `arrivals_ma8` = average arrivals over the past 8 bins (24 hours).  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final feature set**\n",
    "   - `hour`, `dayofweek`, `is_weekend`  \n",
    "   - `arrivals_lag1`, `arrivals_lag2`, `arrivals_lag4`  \n",

    "  - **15% Validation** → used to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.  \n",
    "  - **15% Test** → used for final evaluation.  \n",

    "- For each station:\n",
    "  - Take the timeline of arrivals/features.  \n",

    "### Why Poisson LSTM?\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Nature of the data**\n",
    "- Our target variable = **number of EV arrivals** in each 3-hour bin.  \n",
    "- This is **count data** (0, 1, 2, …), not continuous values.  \n",
    "- Count data is often **skewed, sparse, and full of zeros**.  \n",
    "- A normal regression (predicting any real number) would be a poor fit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Why Poisson distribution?**\n",
    "- Poisson distribution is the standard for modeling **event counts in fixed time intervals**.  \n",
    "- It assumes arrivals are random but have an average rate (λ).  \n",
    "- Fits well with our use case: “How many EVs will arrive in the next 3 hours?”  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Why LSTM?**\n",
    "- LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks) are strong at capturing **time dependencies**.  \n",
    "- EV arrivals are not purely random — they follow **temporal patterns**:\n",
    "  - Daily rush hours.  \n",
    "  - Weekday vs weekend differences.  \n",
    "  - Seasonal usage patterns.  \n",
    "- LSTM learns these sequences, remembering the past to forecast the future.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Why combine them (Poisson LSTM)?**\n",
    "- **Poisson output layer** ensures predictions are non-negative and interpretable as counts.  \n",
    "- **LSTM layers** capture sequential trends and patterns across time.  \n",
    "- Together:\n",
    "  - Poisson part = respects the statistical nature of the data.  \n",
    "  - LSTM part = learns temporal behavior from history.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Advantages of Poisson LSTM**\n",
    "- Predictions align better with **real-world arrival distributions**.  \n",
    "- Avoids nonsensical outputs (like negative EV arrivals).  \n",
    "- Handles **spiky and sparse data** better than standard regression LSTM.  \n",
    "- Improves interpretability: the model outputs an expected arrival rate (λ).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **In short:**  \n",
    "We chose **Poisson LSTM** because EV arrivals are **count-based, sparse, and time-dependent**.  \n",
    "- Poisson handles the *count nature*.  \n",
    "- LSTM handles the *time sequence*.  \n",
    "- This combination gives **more realistic and accurate predictions** than plain regression models.\n"

    "### Poisson LSTM Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Model architecture**\n",
    "- **LSTM(64)** → first recurrent layer, outputs sequences.  \n",
    "- **Dropout(0.2)** → prevents overfitting by randomly turning off 20% of neurons.  \n",
    "- **LSTM(32)** → second LSTM layer for deeper learning.  \n",
    "- **Dropout(0.2)** → again prevents overfitting.  \n",
    "- **Dense(16, relu)** → fully connected layer to learn complex patterns.  \n",
    "- **Dense(1, softplus)** → final output (predicted arrivals).  \n",
    "  - `softplus` ensures predictions are **non-negative**, which is important since arrivals can’t be negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Compilation**\n",
    "- Optimizer: **Adam (learning rate 0.001)** → efficient and adaptive.  \n",
    "- Loss: **Poisson** → suitable for count data like arrivals.  \n",
    "- Metric: **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** → average size of prediction errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Weighting spikes**\n",
    "- Normal bins (0 arrivals) are very common.  \n",
    "- To make sure the model also learns from **spikes (non-zero bins)**, we give them extra weight (`alpha = 8`).  \n",
    "- This way, rare busy periods matter more in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Callbacks**\n",
    "- **EarlyStopping** → stop training if validation loss doesn’t improve for 8 epochs.  \n",
    "- `restore_best_weights=True` → keep the best-performing model, not just the last one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Training**\n",
    "- Training data: `Xtr, ytr`.  \n",
    "- Validation data: `Xva, yva`.  \n",
    "- Epochs: up to 60 (but early stopping usually ends earlier).  \n",
    "- Batch size: 64.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Training results**\n",
    "- The **loss curve** shows training loss vs validation loss.  \n",
    "- Both loss values decrease, which means the model is learning.  \n",
    "- The validation MAE stabilizes around **0.26–0.29**, showing the model generalizes well.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **In short:**  \n",
    "We trained a **Poisson LSTM** that predicts non-negative arrival counts using 48 hours of history.  \n",
    "To avoid overfitting, we used dropout and early stopping.  \n",
    "We also gave extra weight to spikes so the model learns peak times better.  \n",
    "The training curves confirm the model is learning and not overfitting badly.\n"

    "  - **MAE ≈ 0.30** → average error is less than 1 arrival per 3-hour bin.  \n",
    "  - **RMSE ≈ 0.47** → slightly higher due to penalizing bigger errors.  \n",
    "  - **sMAPE ≈ 86%** → percentage error is high because true values are often very small (0 or 1).  \n",

    "  - Convert charging times to hours.  \n",
    "  - Take the inverse (1/duration = sessions per hour).  \n",
    "  - Remove extreme outliers (only keep middle 80%).  \n",

    "- This makes baseline models more meaningful and fair when compared with LSTM.  \n",

    "- Baseline models are **reference forecasts** to test whether our advanced model (Poisson-LSTM) really adds value.  \n",
    "- If the LSTM cannot beat baselines, it may not be worth the added complexity.  \n",
    "- Types used here:\n",
    "  - **Naive:** assumes the next value = last observed value.  \n",
    "  - **Seasonal Naive:** repeats the value from the same time yesterday (captures daily cycles).  \n",
    "  - **Moving Average:** smooths past few values to predict the next one.  \n",
    "  - **Prophet (Meta):** flexible model with built-in daily and weekly seasonality.  \n",
    "  - **SARIMA:** classical statistical model that captures autocorrelation and seasonality using autoregression and differencing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Baselines are critical to **validate the value** of our Poisson-LSTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "**3. Building the 3-hour time series**\n",
    "- Function `_build_3h_from_raw()`:\n",
    "  - Reads the dataset (`pre-processed-dataset.csv`).  \n",
    "  - Converts timestamps (`created`, `ended`) to datetime.  \n",
    "  - Drops rows with missing times.  \n",
    "  - Creates a continuous **3-hour timeline** from the earliest to the latest date.  \n",
    "  - Groups sessions by station + 3-hour bin, counting arrivals.  \n",
    "  - Fills missing bins with `0` → ensures each station has a complete time series.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Reuse if available**\n",
    "- If a `timeseries_3h` DataFrame already exists in memory, reuse it.  \n",
    "- Otherwise, rebuild from the raw CSV file.  \n",
    "- Saves time and avoids recomputation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Final baseline dataset**\n",
    "- Columns:  \n",
    "  - `stationId` → the charging station.  \n",
    "  - `timestamp` → 3-hour bin.  \n",
    "  - `arrivals` → number of sessions started in that bin.  \n",
    "- Sorted and indexed for consistency.  \n",
    "- Example: Station `228137` shows `0` arrivals for several consecutive bins, reflecting the low demand nature of the dataset.  \n",

    "✅ **In short:**  \n",
    "We build a clean **3-hour arrivals time series** as the foundation for baseline models.  \n",
    "We then test **simple (Naive, Seasonal Naive, Moving Average)** and **advanced statistical models (Prophet, SARIMA)** to act as **yardsticks**.  \n",
