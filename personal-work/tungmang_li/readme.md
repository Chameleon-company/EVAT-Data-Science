# EVAT Gamification System

This repository contains three main parts of the EVAT gamification system:

1. **Data-Science** – reinforcement learning (RL) environment and training scripts
2. **Backend** – gamification APIs with database integration
3. **Frontend** – website integration with EVAT “Game” tab

---

## 1. Data-Science

The **Data-Science** folder contains the reinforcement learning training setup for simulating user behaviors and testing reward mechanisms.

### Files required

Make sure the following files are in the **same directory**:

* `simulated_user_actions.json` – generated by `random_events.py`
* `EVATGamificationEnv.py` – custom RL environment
* `lr_train.ipynb` – notebook to train the model

### Run training

1. Open and run **`lr_train.ipynb`**.
2. The notebook will train a learning model based on the simulated user actions.

### Generate new data

If you want to generate more user activity events:

```bash
python random_events.py
```

This creates a new `simulated_user_actions.json` file.

📄 For more details, see **EVAT Gamification RL Model Implementation v2.pdf**.

## 2. Backend

The **Backend** provides the APIs and database logic for gamification features.

### Setup

1. Clone the backend repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chameleon-company/EVAT-App-BE
   ```
2. Set up the local environment (Node.js + MongoDB).
3. Clone the EVAT database locally and ensure user authentication is available (refer to standard EVAT login flow).

### Run API

After setup, you can call gamification APIs locally. Example:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/gamification/items/manage/all
```

📄 API schema and database details are in **EVAT Gamification Backend Implementation v3.pdf**.

---

## 3. Frontend

The **Frontend** integrates gamification features into the EVAT website.

### Setup

1. Clone the frontend repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chameleon-company/EVAT-Website
   ```
2. Run the project locally.

### Usage

* After logging into the EVAT homepage, you will see a **“Game”** tab in the navigation bar.
* Click the tab to open the Game page.
* Perform different actions to see **game points increase**.

📄 Detailed frontend implementation is in **EVAT Gamification Website Implementation v2.pdf**.

## Summary

* **Data-Science** → Train RL model with `lr_train.ipynb`.
* **Backend** → Run gamification APIs.
* **Frontend** → See the gamification UI under the “Game” tab.
