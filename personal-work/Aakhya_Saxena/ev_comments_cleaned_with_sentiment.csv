teslamotors,7e2ze2,Tesla vs Bugatti,dq24dq8,"Bugatti hasn’t even attempted top speed in their car yet. The 261 is just what they limit the car to right now for their customers.  Everyone knows it will be 280mph+, the question is can they find new tires that let them reach 300.  If you read Motor Trend’s review of the Chiron, they said a $180k Turbo S would accelerate as fast in 0-60, but the Chiron feels to accelerate faster from 60-180mph than it does 0-60, that’s where most of the power delivery is.  It’s odd that Tesla only bragged about 0-60 and 0-100mph numbers, for most hyper cars that aim for 250mph+ top speed, they brag about 0-124, 60-150, or 0-200mph time, that’s where the differences lie.   Actually they mostly brag about lap times around the Nurburgring, since that’s a better indicator of the overall performance of a vehicle.    One big concern with EV in this context is that due to the nature of EV, a powerful car would require a big battery pack, and current battery technology means it will be a very heavy battery pack. Weight is public enemy number one as far as motor sport engineering is concerned, so the Roadster's track performance is still a big question mark at this point. I personally think if they solve the battery cooling issue, it should be very respectable, but very, very unlikely to be record setting considering some of the [bat shit insane stuff](https://jalopnik.com/the-1000-horsepower-mercedes-amg-project-one-this-is-1803141648) that's coming out right around the same time.  Fun fact: right now there is a [pissing match between Bugatti and Koenigsegg](https://www.topgear.com/car-news/pioneers/koenigsegg-agera-rs-smashes-bugattis-0-249mph-0-time), would love to see the new Roadster jumping into the foray.   Edit: Don’t get me wrong, I love, *love* the new Roadster, and it's super cool that now an electric car will likely be the king of drag races. But it’s not the be all end all sports car and the world of hypercars go far beyond 0-60 and quarter mile races.",bugatti hasnt even attempted top speed in their car yet the is just what they limit the car to right now for their customers everyone knows it will be mph the question is can they find new tires that let them reach if you read motor trends review of the chiron they said a k turbo s would accelerate as fast in but the chiron feels to accelerate faster from mph than it does thats where most of the power delivery is its odd that tesla only bragged about and mph numbers for most hyper cars that aim for mph top speed they brag about or mph time thats where the differences lie actually they mostly brag about lap times around the nurburgring since thats a better indicator of the overall performance of a vehicle one big concern with ev in this context is that due to the nature of ev a powerful car would require a big battery pack and current battery technology means it will be a very heavy battery pack weight is public enemy number one as far as motor sport engineering is concerned so the roadsters track performance is still a big question mark at this point i personally think if they solve the battery cooling issue it should be very respectable but very very unlikely to be record setting considering some of the bat shit insane stuff thats coming out right around the same time fun fact right now there is a pissing match between bugatti and koenigsegg would love to see the new roadster jumping into the foray edit dont get me wrong i love love the new roadster and its super cool that now an electric car will likely be the king of drag races but its not the be all end all sports car and the world of hypercars go far beyond and quarter mile races,positive

teslamotors,7e2ze2,Tesla vs Bugatti,dq2i74n,"I m extremely interested in the solutions that Tesla has come up with for the issue of tires on the new Roadster.  For instance, the Veyron and Chiron have specially engineered tires that can withstand the forces associated with going ""250+"" miles per hour.    The Dodge Demon has specially engineered tires to allow it the grip necessary to do 0-60 in 2.3 seconds.  However, those special tires that let the Veyron go at its top speed don't give it the super soft grip that it needs to set a good 0-60 and the Dodge Demon is electronically limited to 168 MPH because at speeds faster than that those super soft tires that give it the grip to launch would simply tear apart.  So I am very interested in how Tesla is going to get around these issues and what tires they will run.  I have no doubt that on paper in a physics universe the three electric motors make enough power to propel the frame 0-60 in 1.9 or to get it to 250+, but the real world of car racing is such that the tires and other factors will come into play.

teslamotors,l7fw2f,Elon Burn Ouch 🤕,gl997lo,"This is the 32nd most popular post on this subreddit.. of ALL TIME.  I've followed this subreddit every single day for the last 4 years since I initially invested and bought my first Tesla. I've followed the company for 12 years. I've let a lot of shit slide that Elon has pulled - from the MCU memory issue, the P90D power limitation fiasco, the rated range reduction, Elon's COVID rants, MCU2 price reduction, never releasing early access to early FSD purchases and then giving them to YouTubers, and many more. I've stayed strong.  This however, is one thing where I am losing confidence in Tesla. This is yet another heavy blow to early adopters who have poured their time, money, and energy into the company and bootstrapping it toward success. People (like me) who paid extra for FSD as far back as 2016. My confidence in this company and the vision of FSD is waning. How much longer can Elon pump FSD being completed ""this year"" while simultaneously ignoring the passage of time and the vast amount of people who are getting absolutely shafted by purchasing the upgrade? From leased late 2016/2017 FSD purchasers who effectively got nothing but broken NoA during their lease to the people who outright fronted cash for a pre-order of features to come and then sold their vehicle in a devalued trade-in or private sale... it's coming to a fever pitch.

This was written by Elon's ex-wife Justine:  ""Mary Beth Brown started working for Elon (as his personal assistant/secretary) soon after we moved to LA twelve years ago (Elon and I were still married then).  MB was an exceptional and devoted employee of Elon's and lovely to deal with on a personal level. She gave her life to the job -- and to our family -- and the news of her departure was a shock to me.  Apparently (according, I believe, to Ashlee Vance, who wrote the book on Elon), MB asked for a raise. E told her that if she was truly critical to SpaceX, it should not be able to operate in her absence (or something to that effect).  He suggested a 3-week experiment to test this hypothesis/her worth.  This reminds me of something similar he once said to me after I came back from a week's visit with my family-- that his life had operated quite smoothly in my absence.  He was letting me know that I was an incompetent house manager. (He was not wrong.)  So of the different stories I have heard behind MB's departure from SpaceX, this is the one that resonates with me. (Although you would *never* use the word 'incompetent' in association with MB!)""

Not because I do hand-over-hand - I really don't and I learned not to do that early in driving school - but a full circle steering wheel gives you security when turning and for example, getting a flat tire.  Just imagine yourself doing a quite sharp turn with this - I am certain at some point you will have only one hand on steering. Full circle gives you ability to have all hands all time on steering. With this design, either ratio in steering has to be quite rapid, making it quite difficult to just rest your hands, or there might be torque vectoring on rear wheels, supporting the steering.  Either way, I will NOT feel safe using this, regardless of how modern it is, or how convenient it might be.  And last thing - with full circle, you can shift hands anywhere on steering, and relax a bit. This thing will force you to keep hands in same position, and less trained person will find that quite tiring on arms really fast.  I can not comprehend the thought process of people in comments here defending this design - even supersport cars have a full circle steering wheel.

electricvehicles,1jc7cr3,From two Tesla's to none.,mi2dfqq,"I wanted to take a moment to express something that has been weighing on my mind lately, particularly regarding the trend of people selling their Teslas due to political reasons. It’s a sad reality that, in a time where environmental concerns and technological advancement should unite us, political polarization has seeped into even the most forward-thinking of spaces.  Tesla, at its core, represents innovation, sustainability, and a future where we move away from fossil fuels in favor of cleaner energy. It’s a symbol of progress—something we should all rally behind regardless of political affiliation. Yet, since the re-election of Trump and Elon’s affiliation with him, we’ve seen increasing numbers of people selling their Teslas, not because of any mechanical or financial reason, but because of the political views of the company’s CEO, Elon Musk. It’s disheartening to think that such an important symbol of the green movement has become embroiled in the very politics that many of us are desperately trying to move beyond.  The issue lies not in the products themselves but in how we’ve allowed our differences to overshadow shared values. Instead of seeing Teslas as a necessary step forward in reducing our carbon footprint and combating climate change, they’ve become another battleground for ideological wars. People are letting their politics dictate their actions in a way that detracts from the larger, more critical conversation—how to transition to a sustainable future for everyone, regardless of party lines.  It’s also disheartening because many individuals who are selling their Teslas may be unintentionally undermining the very progress they claim to support. The more we divide over political ideologies, the further we move from the collaborative spirit needed to solve the pressing issues of our time, like climate change. By selling a Tesla simply due to political differences with Musk, it’s easy to forget the bigger picture—our collective responsibility to preserve the planet for future generations. It’s as though we’ve allowed politics to fracture our collective progress.  At the end of the day, it’s a reminder of how much we have yet to learn about bridging divides in a world that’s becoming increasingly polarized. It’s a call for all of us to remember that the road to a better future is one that should unite, not divide. Let’s focus on the causes that truly matter, like advancing renewable energy, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, and embracing the technologies that can take us there—no matter who leads the charge.",i wanted to take a moment to express something that has been weighing on my mind lately particularly regarding the trend of people selling their teslas due to political reasons its a sad reality that in a time where environmental concerns and technological advancement should unite us political polarization has seeped into even the most forwardthinking of spaces tesla at its core represents innovation sustainability and a future where we move away from fossil fuels in favor of cleaner energy its a symbol of progresssomething we should all rally behind regardless of political affiliation yet since the reelection of trump and elons affiliation with him weve seen increasing numbers of people selling their teslas not because of any mechanical or financial reason but because of the political views of the companys ceo elon musk its disheartening to think that such an important symbol of the green movement has become embroiled in the very politics that many of us are desperately trying to move beyond the issue lies not in the products themselves but in how weve allowed our differences to overshadow shared values instead of seeing teslas as a necessary step forward in reducing our carbon footprint and combating climate change theyve become another battleground for ideological wars people are letting their politics dictate their actions in a way that detracts from the larger more critical conversationhow to transition to a sustainable future for everyone regardless of party lines its also disheartening because many individuals who are selling their teslas may be unintentionally undermining the very progress they claim to support the more we divide over political ideologies the further we move from the collaborative spirit needed to solve the pressing issues of our time like climate change by selling a tesla simply due to political differences with musk its easy to forget the bigger pictureour collective responsibility to preserve the planet for future generations its as though weve allowed politics to fracture our collective progress at the end of the day its a reminder of how much we have yet to learn about bridging divides in a world thats becoming increasingly polarized its a call for all of us to remember that the road to a better future is one that should unite not divide lets focus on the causes that truly matter like advancing renewable energy reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and embracing the technologies that can take us thereno matter who leads the charge,positive

Once Tesla got engaged, they were great about getting the car in quickly and doing all the diagnostic work they could think of. They had even seen my Reddit posts, so they were up to date on the situation without having to explain anything.  The weren’t able to replicate the issue, but wound up replacing the charge port anyway to be safe. The data from the car suggested a voltage spike during charging which caused the charge port to enter a fault  state and shut off. It’s unclear why the cord would not disengage, but I’m assuming it was able to do so once that fault cleared itself overnight. This makes some sense as it was pouring rain a few minutes prior to us charging, which I was told is the main culprit for this voltage spike fault.  Since then, we’ve had no issues with charging (knock on wood). But I’m certainly more careful hesitant to charge in the middle of nowhere unless I absolutely have to haha.

The weren’t able to replicate the issue, but wound up replacing the charge port anyway to be safe. They also replaced some parts in the charger to be safe as well. The data from the car suggested a voltage spike during charging which caused the charge port to enter a fault  state and shut off. It’s unclear why the cord would not disengage, but I’m assuming it was able to do so once that fault cleared itself overnight. This makes some sense as it was pouring rain a few minutes prior to us charging, which I was told is the main culprit for this voltage spike fault.
